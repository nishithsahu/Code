/*Chef and Divyam are playing a game with the following rules:

First, an integer X! is written on a board.
Chef and Divyam alternate turns; Chef plays first.
In each move, the current player should choose a positive integer D which is divisible by up to Y distinct primes and does not exceed the integer currently written on the board. Note that 1 is not a prime.
D is then subtracted from the integer on the board, i.e. if the integer written on the board before this move was A, it is erased and replaced by Aâˆ’D.
When one player writes 0 on the board, the game ends and this player wins.
Given X and Y, determine the winner of the game*/
